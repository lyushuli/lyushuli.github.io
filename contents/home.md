I, Shuli Lv, am a PhD candidate at Rfly Lab (rfly.buaa.edu.cn) of Beihang University. My supervisor is Prof. Quan Quan. I proposed the concept of time-optimal spatial iterative learning for robotic navigation. My research direction is to introduce functional variation to enable iterative learning to handle navigation problems, and further implement engineering in single/multi-agent intelligence.
